## Features
### Arithmetic Operations:

- Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
- Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
- Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
- Division (/): Divides the first number by the second.
- Exponentiation (^): Raises the first number to the power of the second.
### Bitwise Operations:

- Bitwise AND (&&): Performs a bitwise AND operation on two numbers and displays the result in binary.
- Bitwise OR (||): Performs a bitwise OR operation on two numbers and displays the result in binary.
- Bitwise XOR (XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR operation on two numbers and displays the result in binary.
### Equality Comparison:

- Equality (==): Compares two numbers for equality and displays the result in binary.
